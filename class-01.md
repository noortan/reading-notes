**Note**: The content inside the <body> section (the white area above) will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.


**Extra Markup on HTML**

1. HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag
2. HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
3. HTML links are defined with the <a> tag
4. HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

### HTML Layout Elements
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

HTML5 Semantic Elements	
* **<header>** - Defines a header for a document or a section
* **<nav>** - Defines a set of navigation links
* **<section>** - Defines a section in a document
* **<article>** - Defines an independent, self-contained content
* **<aside>** - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
* **<footer>** - Defines a footer for a document or a section
* **<details>** - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
* **<summary>** - Defines a heading for the <details> element

Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:

**A**  
What is a script and how do I create one?

**B**  
How do computers fit in with the world around them?

**C**  
How do I write a script for a web page?

Once you have learned the basics, the following chapters will show how the JavaScript language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.

### WHAT IS A SCRIPT AND HOW DO I CREATE ONE?
A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following:

RECIPES
By following the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.

Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish. Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe for a complicated three-course meal.

Another similarity is that, if you are new to cooking or programming, there is a lot of new terminology to learn.

HANDBOOKS
Large companies often provide handbooks for new employees that contain procedures to follow in certain situations.

For example, hotel handbooks may contain steps to follow in different scenarios such as when a guest checks in, ...
