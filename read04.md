# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

### JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators

JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:
